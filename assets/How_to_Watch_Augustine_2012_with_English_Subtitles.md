Augustine (2012) is a film that challenges the conventional views of hysteria, a condition that was mostly diagnosed in women and often attributed to psychological or sexual causes. The film shows how Augustine's symptoms, such as seizures, paralysis, and loss of voice, are treated by Dr. Charcot with various methods, such as hypnosis, electrotherapy, and public demonstrations. The film also depicts the complex and ambiguous relationship between the doctor and the patient, who develop a mutual fascination and attraction.
 
The film is based on real historical figures and events, but it also takes some artistic liberties and fictionalizes some aspects of the story. For example, the film portrays Augustine as a young and attractive woman, while in reality she was older and less conventionally beautiful. The film also suggests a romantic involvement between Augustine and Dr. Charcot, while there is no evidence of such a relationship in the historical records.
 
Nevertheless, the film is a compelling and captivating portrayal of a fascinating chapter in the history of medicine and psychology. It also raises questions about the ethics and power dynamics of medical research and treatment, especially when it involves vulnerable and marginalized patients. The film is a must-watch for anyone interested in these topics or in the genre of historical drama.
  
One of the strengths of the film is the performance of the two main actors, Vincent Lindon and Soko. Lindon plays Dr. Charcot as a charismatic and authoritative figure, who is also conflicted and curious about his patient. Soko plays Augustine as a vulnerable and rebellious woman, who is both fascinated and frightened by her condition and her doctor. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable and nuanced, creating a tense and captivating atmosphere.
 
The film also has a remarkable visual style, with a dark and muted color palette that reflects the gloomy and oppressive setting of the hospital. The film uses minimal music and sound effects, relying mostly on the natural sounds of the environment and the characters' voices. The film also employs close-ups and long takes to create a sense of intimacy and realism.
 
Augustine (2012) is a film that offers a unique and intriguing perspective on a historical phenomenon that is often misunderstood or misrepresented. The film is not only a fascinating exploration of hysteria and its treatment, but also a compelling story of human emotions and desires. The film is a rewarding and engaging experience for anyone who appreciates quality cinema.
